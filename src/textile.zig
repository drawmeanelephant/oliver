//! Textile frontend.
//!
//! Blocks: paragraphs, `h1.`–`h6.` headings, single-period `bq.` block
//! quotes, `*`/`#` lists with marker-depth nesting, `dl.` definition
//! lists (`term:definition` lines with multi-line definitions, Textile
//! 2), `|a|b|` tables (single-line rows with cell modifiers, an
//! optional `table<mods>.` signature, colspan/rowspan, and Textile 2's
//! header-alignment propagation), and the `clear.` marker (a lone
//! `clear.`/`clear<.`/`clear>.` line parks a CSS clear fragment that
//! the next block to open carries in its style attribute; Textile 2
//! "clear"). Inlines: plain text,
//! hard line breaks, same-line `@code@` phrases, the phrase-modifier family
//! (`*strong*`, `_emphasis_`, `**bold**`, `__italic__`, `-deleted-`,
//! `+inserted+`, `^superscript^`, `~subscript~`, `%span%`,
//! `??citation??`), `"text":url` links (with `(title)`), `!url!` images
//! (with `(alt)` and the `!url!:href` link attachment), and Hobix's
//! `ABC(def)` acronyms (the definition becomes the `title`).
//! Behavior is chosen from the published user-facing Textile documentation
//! (Hobix reference; Movable Type "Textile 2 Syntax"; Textile Markup Language
//! Documentation) where the slice implements it; disagreements between
//! versions and Oliver's chosen resolutions are recorded in
//! docs/FEATURE-MATRIX.md and docs/TEXTILE-INLINE-CODE.md and the parity
//! audit docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md.
//!
//! Chosen behaviors for this slice:
//! - Blocks are separated by blank lines.
//! - A block marker (`hN.`, `p.`, `bq.`) must be followed by a space or tab to
//!   count as a marker; otherwise the line is ordinary paragraph text.
//! - Marker lines start a new block even without a preceding blank line
//!   (recorded ambiguity; see docs/FEATURE-MATRIX.md).
//! - A single-period `bq.` block continues through unmarked lines until a blank
//!   line or another recognized block marker. Its content is one paragraph
//!   inside a block quote. Extended `bq..` keeps the quote active across blank
//!   lines (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §10), and the citation form `bq.:URL`
//!   renders the URL as the blockquote's `cite` attribute (§12).
//! - `bq.` followed only by separator whitespace is literal: the user-facing
//!   documentation does not define an empty block-quote form.
//! - A newline inside a paragraph is a hard line break (Textile 2: "newlines
//!   for XHTML content receive a `<br />` tag at the end of the line").
//! - `@code@` is recognized only within one line, with the conservative
//!   whitespace/punctuation boundary contract in docs/TEXTILE-INLINE-CODE.md.
//!   Code content is an opaque, verbatim `.code_span` payload.
//! - Phrase modifiers, links, and images use the same boundary contract and
//!   are recognized within one line; phrase content is scanned for nested
//!   phrases, while link display text and image src/alt are opaque plain
//!   text (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §4). The family includes Textile 2's
//!   `++bigger++` → `<big>` and `--smaller--` → `<small>` (the `--` pair is
//!   a phrase delimiter; a `--` that cannot form a pair still becomes an
//!   em dash, docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §17), and `??citation??` → `<cite>`
//!   (Hobix, the citation operator). Any phrase operator can carry
//!   the documented phrase attributes just inside its opener
//!   (`*{style}(class#id)[lang]x*`, `%{style}x%`, Hobix "Phrase
//!   Attributes"), composing through the block-attribute machinery onto
//!   the phrase's own HTML tag (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §18/§19).
//! - `[alias]url` lines anywhere in the document define link aliases; a
//!   `"text":alias` link resolves to the defined URL even when the
//!   definition comes later (both references document the lookup table).
//!   Definition lines never render (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §7).
//! - The `clear.` marker (Textile 2 "clear") must be alone on its line
//!   (only trailing whitespace after the `.`, or after the `<`/`>`
//!   direction for `clear<.`/`clear>.`) to count; any content after the
//!   marker makes the line ordinary text. The marker itself renders
//!   nothing; the next block carries `style="clear:both;"` (or
//!   `left`/`right`), merged ahead of any style the block already has
//!   (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §22).
//! - `notextile.`/`notextile..` (current Textile docs "No formatting
//!   (override Textile)"; Textile 2 uses the `==` escape instead) opens a
//!   raw block whose content passes through as one `.html_block` leaf,
//!   unformatted and unescaped — the signature form of the `==` region.
//!   The single period owns every following non-blank line (ending at a
//!   blank line, like `bc.`); the double period keeps blank lines as
//!   content and runs until the next block signature (like `bc..`). A
//!   bare marker (no same-line content) opens a block whose content is the
//!   following lines; an empty block renders nothing
//!   (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §23).
//! - Paragraph content is preserved verbatim (only the marker's separator
//!   whitespace is consumed).
//! - `h0.` and `h7.`+ are not headings; they remain paragraph text.
//! - Plain text gets the documented character replacements: curly quotes
//!   (direction by the surrounding source bytes), `--` → em dash, ` - ` →
//!   en dash, `...` → ellipsis, digit-adjacent `x` → dimension sign, and
//!   `(c)`/`(r)`/`(tm)` (case-insensitive) + `(1/4)`/`(1/2)`/`(3/4)`/
//!   `(o)`/`(+/-)` → their Unicode equivalents, and Textile 2's `{...}`
//!   character-macro table (`{c|}`/`{|c}` → ¢, `{L-}`/`{-L}` → £,
//!   `{Y=}`/`{=Y}` → ¥, `{A'}`/`{'A}` → Á, `{a"}`/`{"a}` → ä, `{1/4}` →
//!   ¼, `{*}` → •, `{:)}` → ☺, `{:(}` → ☹ — operators at a brace edge
//!   are not phrase delimiters, so the brace region stays whole).
//!   HTML-looking `<...>` regions and verbatim payloads (`@code@`, code
//!   blocks, link/image src/alt/title) are exempt; replaced text is an
//!   arena-owned payload (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §13/§18).
//! - A list item is a single line: `*` (bullet) or `#` (ordered) markers,
//!   one per nesting level, followed by a space or tab. Consecutive marker
//!   lines compose a tree of tight lists; a blank line, a block signature,
//!   or a non-marker text line closes all open lists (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md
//!   §6).
//! - A table is its own block: consecutive row lines (`|a|b|`, or rows with
//!   leading modifiers) compose one table until a blank line or any other
//!   block-level line. An optional `table<mods>.` signature opens one, with
//!   the first row on the same line (Textile 2) or on following lines
//!   (Hobix). A row must start with `|` (after modifiers) and end with `|`;
//!   every `|` splits (Textile has no pipe escape). Cell modifiers are
//!   terminated by a period followed by a space (the documented contract);
//!   row modifiers end at the first `|` (Textile 2) or after `. ` (Hobix).
//!   A header cell's alignment becomes the default for the cells below it
//!   in the same column (Textile 2); cells render as flat `<tr>` rows with
//!   no thead/tbody (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §7).
//! - Block signatures carry the full attribute set: `p{style}.`,
//!   `p(class#id).`, `p[lang].`, `p().` indentation, and `p<.`/`p>.`/`p=.`/
//!   `p<>.` alignment — the modifiers sit between the marker and its
//!   period, for `p`, `bq`, and `hN` alike (Hobix §4;
//!   docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §8).
//! - `bc.` block code and `pre.` preformatted text open a leaf that owns
//!   every following non-blank line verbatim until a blank line (Textile 2:
//!   "a block ends with the first blank line"). `bc` escapes `<`/`>` and
//!   renders `<pre><code>`; `pre` is verbatim `<pre>`.
//! - Extended signatures (`bq..`, `bc..`, `pre..`, optional modifiers
//!   before the double period) stay active across blank lines until the
//!   next block signature (Textile 2 "Extended Blocks"): `bq..` becomes
//!   one blockquote of blank-line-separated paragraphs, and `bc..`/`pre..`
//!   keep blank lines as code content.
//! - Footnotes: `[N]` inline becomes `<sup class="footnote"><a
//!   href="#fnN">N</a></sup>`, and an `fnN.` paragraph renders
//!   `<p class="footnote" id="fnN"><sup>N</sup> …</p>` (Textile 2
//!   "Footnotes"; the Hobix form lacks the classes).
//! - `==` escaping (Textile 2 "Escaping"): a lone `==` line (trailing
//!   whitespace allowed) opens a block-escape region whose content passes
//!   through as a raw `.html_block` — unformatted and unescaped, for
//!   dropping regular HTML into the document. An inline `==...==` suspends
//!   all inline formatting and the character replacements for the delimited
//!   span, which renders as literal text (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §14).
//! - Line attributes: a line beginning with `|mods|. ` — a §8
//!   block-modifier run between pipes, then a period, a space, and
//!   content — applies the modifier set to the paragraph, converging with
//!   the `p<mods>.` marker machinery (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §15).
//! - Image modifiers: an alignment/style/class/padding run right after
//!   `!` (`!<x!`, `!{style}x!`, `!(class)x!`, `!()x!`), and a size token
//!   after the src (`10x20`, `10w 20h`, `20%`) — composed into the
//!   `.image` width/height and attribute list through the block-attribute
//!   machinery (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §16).

// Tables.
//
// A table is its own block: consecutive row lines compose one table until a
// blank line or any other block-level line. Rows are `|a|b|` lines (with an
// optional leading modifier run: `_` header, `<`/`>`/`=`/`<>` alignment,
// `^`/`~` valign, `{style}`, `(class#id)`, `[lang]`, `(`/`)` padding — row
// modifiers end at the first `|` per Textile 2 or after `. ` per Hobix). An
// optional `table<mods>.` signature opens the table (Hobix: alone on its
// own line; Textile 2: followed by the first row). Cell modifiers follow
// the same tokens plus `\n` colspan and `/n` rowspan, and must be
// terminated by a period followed by a space (the documented contract);
// every other shape keeps the whole cell verbatim. Alignment propagates:
// a header cell's alignment becomes the default for the cells below it in
// the same column (Textile 2), resolved at close time when the whole table
// is visible. Cells render as flat `<tr>` rows — the references show no
// thead/tbody (docs/TEXTILE-PARITY.md §7).
