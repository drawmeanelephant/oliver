# GitHub Pages publication

Oliver publishes this `docs/` tree to GitHub Pages with a Boris binary built
from a pinned Boris revision. The official workflow lives at
`.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`. It builds the documentation with the
native Boris binary, resolves the Pages location through
`actions/configure-pages`, validates that location in a Boris publication
profile, and deploys only the verified public site tree.

Oliver is the markdown rendering library *inside* Boris; the dependency is
one-way at the toolchain level. Boris pins Oliver as a library in its own
`build.zig.zon`, and this repository uses a Boris binary to publish its docs —
there is no build cycle. The Boris revision is pinned in the workflow and
recorded in the retained evidence, so the binary that produced the site is
always identifiable.

```

Each stage is governed by a normative contract in
[`contracts/`](contracts/index.html):

| Stage | What it produces / does | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| Profile | `jq` builds the profile from `configure-pages`; `boris plan --profile` validates it | [publication-profile](contracts/publication-profile.html) |
| Plan | normalized declaration with `site_kind` and the cross-checked `base_url`/`origin`/`base_path` | [publication-plan](contracts/publication-plan.html) |
| Validate | local preflight: renders pages + sitemap in memory, no writes; skips the post-render link audit, so the CI gate runs the full compile ([boris#430](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/boris/issues/430)) | — (see compile) |
| Compile | HTML + sitemap under `dist/`; every URL projection audited against the declared location; proof reports emitted | [publication-model](contracts/publication-model.html) · [checks](contracts/publication-checks.html) · [claims](contracts/publication-claims.html) |
| Artifact | inventory-verified copy into `public-site/` (bytes + SHA-256, `index.html`, 1 GiB bound) | [artifacts](contracts/publication-artifacts.html) · [touches](contracts/publication-touches.html) · [proof pack](contracts/publication-proof-pack.html) |
| Deploy | `deploy-pages` publishes the artifact to the `github-pages` environment | — (GitHub's contract) |
| Audit (optional) | bounded HTTP observation bound to the retained plan and inventory | [deployment evidence](contracts/github-pages-deployment-evidence.html) |

## Enable the target

In the repository’s **Settings → Pages**, choose **GitHub Actions** as the
source. The workflow runs for pushes to `main` and can also be started with
**Run workflow**. The workflow uses the supported Pages action sequence:

1. `actions/checkout@v6`
2. `actions/configure-pages@v5`
3. `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4`
4. `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

The workflow references immutable action commits with the released major
version in a comment. The Zig setup action is likewise pinned to the reviewed
`v2.2.1` commit. The deploy job requires a `github-pages` environment (create
it in **Settings → Environments** if it does not exist; add protection rules
as desired).

It grants `contents: read` and `pages: read` to the build job. The deployment
job alone receives `pages: write` and `id-token: write`. Build and deployment
concurrency is serialized so an older run cannot cancel a newer deployment
halfway through.

## Toolchain: the pinned Boris revision

The workflow checks out the Boris repository at the workflow-level `BORIS_REV`
environment variable into `boris/`, installs Zig 0.16.0, and builds the
toolchain:

```text
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe      # in boris/
```

`BORIS_REV` is the single bump point for the toolchain pin; it is referenced
from both checkouts (build and optional audit observer) and recorded in the
retained evidence and build summary. Bump it only after locally re-validating
against this `docs/` tree (see [Local parity](#local-parity-and-the-starter-profile))
at the new revision. The reference workflow builds Boris from its own source;
Oliver cannot do that, so the pinned checkout is the one genuinely new design
decision in the adapted workflow — everything else carries over.

## Location model

GitHub supplies three related values to the workflow: `base_url`, `origin`, and
`base_path`. Boris records them in the temporary profile used by
`boris plan --profile` and rejects contradictions before the site build:

| Pages shape | Example `base_url` | `origin` | `base_path` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project site | `https://drawmeanelephant.github.io/oliver` | `https://drawmeanelephant.github.io` | `/oliver` |
| User/org root site | `https://drawmeanelephant.github.io` | `https://drawmeanelephant.github.io` | empty |
| Custom domain | `https://docs.example.com` | `https://docs.example.com` | empty |

The current declaration slice does not invent a CNAME or probe the network.
If a custom domain is configured with a non-empty path, or if `base_url` does
not equal `origin + base_path`, the profile fails closed. The normalized
identity is also available in the [publication profile](contracts/publication-profile.html)
and [publication plan](contracts/publication-plan.html) contracts.

The build step consumes that normalized plan identity directly:

```text
boris/zig-out/bin/boris --input docs \
  --target public=dist \
  --target-layout public=themes/oliver/layouts/main.html \
  --sitemap \
  --pages-base-url https://drawmeanelephant.github.io/oliver \
  --pages-origin https://drawmeanelephant.github.io \
  --pages-base-path /oliver \
  --site-url https://drawmeanelephant.github.io/oliver \
  --quiet
```

`--input docs` is explicit because the CLI default content root is `content`;
this repository publishes its `docs/` tree with the `themes/oliver` theme. The
compiler audits rendered root-relative/public metadata URLs before target
replacement and binds sitemap URLs to the same identity. `EPUBLICATIONLOCATION`
is an actionable publication failure. Root and custom-domain builds pass an
explicit empty `--pages-base-path`. The check is against the local generated
artifact; this workflow still makes no post-deploy HTTP claim.

## Local parity and the starter profile

Before touching Actions, run the same pipeline locally. The repository ships a
[starter publication profile](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/oliver/blob/main/publication-profile.example.json) declaring
the project-site shape (`input: docs`, `theme: themes/oliver`,
`https://drawmeanelephant.github.io/oliver`) at the repository root, so every
path resolves workspace-relative. From the repository root:

```text
boris/zig-out/bin/boris plan --profile publication-profile.example.json > /tmp/plan.json
boris/zig-out/bin/boris validate --input docs \
  --target public=dist \
  --target-layout public=themes/oliver/layouts/main.html \
  --sitemap \
  --pages-base-url https://drawmeanelephant.github.io/oliver \
  --pages-origin https://drawmeanelephant.github.io \
  --pages-base-path /oliver \
  --site-url https://drawmeanelephant.github.io/oliver
```

`plan` writes the normalized declaration (exit 2 on an invalid profile, 3 on
I/O failure); `validate` renders the pages and sitemap in memory without
writing artifacts. Note that `validate` deliberately skips the post-render
link audit — location escapes (`EPUBLICATIONLOCATION`) and broken local
routes (`EROUTEMISSING`) pass it silently (see
[boris#430](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/boris/issues/430)) — so the
authoritative prepublication check is the full compile command above, which
is exactly what the CI gate runs. Confirm exit 0 before the first CI run. The
profile is the single source of URL truth — never re-derive the Pages
location from the repository name.

## Public artifact and retained evidence

The workflow creates two deliberately different uploads:

- The Pages artifact is copied from the exact `committed` records in
  `dist/_boris/proof/artifacts.json`. The copier checks every byte count and
  SHA-256, requires `index.html`, rejects symlinks and hard links, enforces the
  supported 1 GiB Pages artifact limit, and excludes `_boris/proof` reports.
- The retained evidence artifact contains the normalized plan, the target-local
  proof reports, and `github-pages-evidence.json`. That binding records the
  source commit, the pinned Boris revision and version, workflow identity,
  inventory digest, public file count/bytes, and the exact public-tree manifest
  digest.

The build summary reports the target, resolved URL/path, public payload size,
inventory binding, compiler finding count, the pinned Boris revision, and the
explicit limitation that deployment verification and a post-deploy HTTP audit
are not claimed by this workflow. A successful `deploy-pages` job means GitHub
accepted the Pages artifact for deployment; it is not a Boris claim that every
URL projection or browser request was audited.

## Optional post-deploy audit

The manual **Run workflow** form has an `audit_deployment` boolean, disabled by
default. When enabled, the deploy job downloads the exact retained plan and
target-local inventory from the build job, builds the standalone
`boris-github-pages-audit` Zig tool from the same pinned Boris checkout, and
passes it the successful `deploy-pages` `page_url`. Push-triggered runs keep
the audit disabled unless a future workflow-level control explicitly opts in.

The observer writes and uploads
`boris-github-pages-deployment-evidence-${{ github.run_id }}` as a separate
ordinary artifact. It is never copied into `public-site`, `_boris/proof`, or
the Pages artifact. The deployment summary distinguishes the build artifact,
deployment acceptance, and optional post-deploy audit. The audit step uses
`continue-on-error` so a failed or incomplete observation still reaches the
upload step; the JSON report carries the actionable result and limitations.

The default observer bounds are 256 HTTP requests including redirects, 8 MiB
per decoded response, three redirects per URL, a 10-second per-request
timeout, and 256 parsed URLs per projection/page. It sends no credentials or
cookies, accepts only HTTP(S) deployment URLs inside the normalized Pages
location, and records body digests separately from cache/ETag metadata. See
the [deployment evidence contract](contracts/github-pages-deployment-evidence.html)
for the result vocabulary, evidence binding, and coverage limits.
